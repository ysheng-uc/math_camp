## What is computational social science?

**Social science** is defined as the scientific study of human society and social relationships.^[See [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+science).]

### Disciplines within social science

At the University of Chicago, the social sciences are broken into several distinct disciplines:^[Again, definitions courtesy of Google.]

* Anthropology - science of human societies and cultures and their developments
* Economics - science of production, consumption, and transfer of wealth
* History - science of past events, particularly in human affairs
* Political science - science of who gets what, when, a how^[First promulgated by Harold Lasswell, a PhD grad from UChicago in the 1930s.]
* Psychology - science of behavior and mind
* Sociology - science of the development, structure, and functioning of human society

The Division of the Social Sciences also includes interdisciplinary committees which bridge across multiple disciplines:

* Comparative Human Development - "research examines issues of central concern to socio-cultural anthropology, medical anthropology, comparative education, behavioral biology, language and thought, cultural and developmental psychology"
* Conceptual and Historical Studies of Science - "areas concerned with the history, philosophy, and social relations of science"
* Social Thought - "serious study of many academic topics, and of many philosophical, historical, theological and literary works, is best prepared for by a wide and deep acquaintance with the fundamental issues presupposed in all such studies, that students should learn about these issues by acquainting themselves with a select number of major ancient and modern texts in an inter-disciplinary atmosphere"

### Computational social science

**Computational social science** (CSS) is a modern interdisciplinary approach to the study of social scientific phenomena. Researchers in this field use computers to model, simulated, and analyze social phenomena. While historically CSS was limited to the application of numerical methods and simulation (e.g. agent-based modeling) to complex issues of social science research, over the past decade this has evolved to describe the intersection of computer science, math/statistics, and social science @lazer2009.

```{r css-img, fig.cap = "Source: http://giventhedata.blogspot.com/2013/03/data-science-in-businesscomputational.html"}
# source: http://giventhedata.blogspot.com/2013/03/data-science-in-businesscomputational.html
knitr::include_graphics("images/ccsvenn.jpeg")
```

Computational social scientists leverage "big data" and computational research designs to analyze and study social phenomena. This requires sophistication and training across all three major domains.

### Acquiring CSS skills

To be a competently trained computational social scientist, one needs to develop training and expertise in computer science, social science, and math/statistics. At the University of Chicago and within MACSS, you will receive this training through a range of courses.

## Difference between math, probability, and statistics

In this camp, we will review fundamental methods across the fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics. While related, these fields are distinct from one another. Key attributes of each are listed below.

### Mathematics

* Mathematics is purely abstract
* Based on axioms that are independent from the real world
* If the axioms are accepted, mathematical inferences are certain
* Language for expressing structure and relationships
* Generally proof-based

### Probability

* Systematic and rigorous method for treating uncertainty
* "Mathematical models of uncertain reality"
* Derivation of "applied mathematics"

### Statistics

* Practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a sample
* Making inferences from data that are not entirely certain
* Based on mathematical models, but with deviations from the model (not deterministic)

### Their uses

All are used to study social scientific phenomena:

* Mathematical models
    * Game theory
    * Formal theory
    * Much bigger in economics
    * Defining statistical models and relationships
* Probability/statistics
    * Establishing a structure for relationships between variables using data
    * Inferring relationships and assessing their validity

## Goals for this camp

* Survey math and statistical tools that are foundational to CSS
* Review common mathematical notation
* Apply math/statistics methods
* Prepare students to pass the MACSS math/stats placement exam and enroll in computationally-enhanced course offerings at UChicago

## Course logistics

### Prerequisites for the math camp

* No formal prerequisites
* Who is likely to succeed in this class? You'll probably have prior training in:
    * Linear algebra
    * Calculus
    * Probability theory
    * Statistical inference (data description, assessing bivariate relationships for continuous and categorical variables, linear/logistic regression, etc.)
    * High school/AP/IB training may be sufficient depending on the depth of the course and how recently you completed it

**We assume prior exposure to the content covered in this camp** - our goal is to refresh material which you have previously learned, not teach it to you fresh
    * Impossible to teach all this material from scratch in just three weeks

### Alternatives to this camp

* SOSC 30100 - Mathematics for Social Sciences (aka the Hansen math camp)


### Evaluation

#### Grades

* You don't take this course for a grade
    * Pass/fail (no credit)
    * Show up (virtually), complete the problem sets satisfactorily (not perfectly), and you'll pass
* That said, **it should not matter**
* The irony of grad school
    * Grades no longer matter (or should not)
    * Learn as much material as possible
    * **If you truly only care about learning material, you'll get amazing grades**

#### Pedagogical approach for the camp

We will follow a flipped-classroom design(-ish).

- Each day you will have course notes provided in lieu of the actual lecture. Read these closely as the problem sets are drawn directly from this material.
- Supplemental readings from published textbooks will be listed for each day. You may choose to read these as you find necessary. It is not expected that you read them cover-to-cover. Instead, I suggest concentrating on certain techniques or methods you find especially challenging or confusing.
- Problem sets will be distributed electronically each day, to be submitted via Canvas for evaluation.
- "Homework" is your reading for the next day

The instructional staff (the TAs and myself) are to be your "sherpas" and guide you along your journey. We are here to assist you - please make liberal use of us and your peers as you complete the problem sets. The goal is to provide you with quick feedback so you don't waste time at home struggling through problems you cannot understand or resolve.

Problem sets will be evaluated and returned within 24 hours, and the solution key will be posted for you to review.

#### 15 minute rule

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">15 min rule: when stuck, you HAVE to try on your own for 15 min; after 15 min, you HAVE to ask for help.- Brain AMA <a href="https://t.co/MS7FnjXoGH">pic.twitter.com/MS7FnjXoGH</a></p>&mdash; Rachel Thomas (@math_rachel) <a href="https://twitter.com/math_rachel/status/764931533383749632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We will follow the **15 minute rule** in this class. If you encounter an issue in your problem sets, spend up to 15 minutes troubleshooting the problem on your own. However, if after 15 minutes you still cannot solve the problem, **ask for help**. The instructional staff has office hours spaced throughout the day. Feel free to log in on Zoom to ask your question.
    
### Why are we doing this

What is the point of solving all this math/stats by hand when computers can do it for us?

What, in your experience, were they wrong about?</a>.</div><script async src="https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js"></script>

The truth is that math skills translate to other domains. While perhaps overly simplified, computer science is essentially a bunch of math. Applying mathematical techniques and completing the exercises on the problem sets requires focus, determination, and grit. **You'll need all of that to survive grad school.**

```

## Mathematical notation

### Why math is important to social science

Math provides a consistent language to communicate ideas in an orderly and systematic way. Science uses highly precise language that is not easily interpretable to outsiders. Consider the definition of the term "theory":

::: {.definition name="Lay definition of theory"}
An unproved assumption.
:::

::: {.definition name="Scientific definition of theory"}
A well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment (e.g. empirical support, falsifiable, repeatedly tested).
:::

This leads to potential confusion with interactions between the scientific community and the general public.

::: {.example name="Climate change"}
Predominantly in the United States there is an ideological divide in whether or not people believe it to be true. [Is it real or just "a theory"?](https://www.nps.gov/articles/climatequestion02.htm)
:::

::: {.example name="COVID-19"}
Consider any discussion about scientific evidence related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated conspiracy theories.
:::

Mathematics is an effective way to describe our world. Many physical processes follow precise mathematical models. Social phenomena are less so, but we can still learn from mathematical modeling. Mathematical notation lets us convey **precision** and minimizes the risk of misinterpretation by other scholars

### Example: Paradox of voting

Consider the classic paradox of voting first introduced in @downs1957. Downs identifies how rational voters should weigh the rewards vs. costs of voting. The core principle is if it costs more to vote than the rewards gained from the action, then individuals should not vote in elections. The difference between cost and reward is defined as the **utility** that the person receives from the act (based on an unknown preference scale).

How can we codify this model using mathematical notation?

$$R = PB - C$$

* $R =$ the utility satisfaction of voting
* $P =$ the actual probability that the voter will affect the outcome with her particular vote
* $B =$ the perceived difference in benefits between the two candidates measured in **utiles** (units of utility)
* $C =$ the actual cost of voting in utiles (e.g. time, effort, money)

#### Think-pair-share

* What implications does the model provide?
* How would you express them mathematically?

<details> 
  <summary>**Click for the solution**</summary>
  <p>
  
Some potential implications are:

Implication | Formal statement
------------|------------------
If individuals do not get enough benefit from voting, they will abstain | The voter will abstain if $R < 0$.
Individuals have other things to do on election day (like going to work). If the benefit of voting is not as large as alternative benefits, then individuals will abstain. | The voter may still not vote even if $R > 0$ if there exist other competing activities that produce a higher $R$.
Most elections have thousands, if not millions, of ballots cast. There is no point to voting since any individual ballot is unlikely to change the outcome of the election. Therefore everyone should abstain. | If $P$ is very small, then it is unlikely that this individual will vote.

  </p>
</details>

This leads to the **paradox of voting** - rationally no one should vote, yet many people still do. Why? This is clearly a question worth answering in political science. @downs1957 has been cited over 32000 times, so we know people care about the question. While a pure mathematical model may not be fully accurate, it allows us to delve deeper into the paradox. How should we measure $B$? $C$?

## Sets

A **set** is a collection of objects.

::: {.example}
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & = \{1, 2, 3\} \nonumber  \\
B  & = \{4, 5, 6\}\nonumber  \\
C  & = \{ \text{First year cohort} \} \\
D & = \{ \text{U of Chicago Lecturers} \}
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

::: {.definition}
If $A$ is a set, we say that $x$ is an element of $A$ by writing, $x \in A$. If $x$ is not an element of $A$ then, we write $x \notin A$.
:::

::: {.example}
$$
\begin{aligned}
1 &\in \{ 1, 2, 3\} \\
4 &\in \{4, 5, 6\} \\
\text{Will} &\notin \{ \text{First year cohort} \} \\
\text{Benjamin} &\in \{ \text{U of Chicago Lecturers} \}
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

Why do we care about sets?

* Sets are necessary for probability theory
* Defining the set is equivalent to choosing population of interest (usually)

::: {.definition}
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then we say that $A = B$ if, for all $x \in A$ then $x \in B$ and for all $y \in B$ then $y \in A$.
:::

A test to determine equality:

* Take all elements of $A$, see if in $B$
* Take all elements of $B$, see if in $A$

::: {.definition}
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then we say that $A \subset B$ is, for all $x \in A$, then $x \in B$.
:::

What is the difference between these definitions?

* In the first definition, $A$ and $B$ are identical
* In the second definition, all $x \in A$ are included in $B$, but all $y \in B$ are not necessarily in $A$

### Set builder notation

Some famous sets:

* $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$
* $\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots, \}$
* $\Re = \mbox{Real numbers}$

Use **set builder notation** to identify subsets:

* $[a, b]  = \{x: x \in \Re \text{ and } a \leq x \leq b \}$
* $(a, b]  = \{x: x \in \Re \text{ and } a < x \leq b \}$
* $[a, b)  = \{x: x \in \Re \text{ and } a \leq x <  b \}$
* $(a, b)  = \{x: x \in \Re \text{ and } a < x < b \}$
* $\emptyset$ - empty or null set

### Set operations

We can build new sets with **set operations**.

::: {.definition name="Union"}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. Define the **Union** of sets $A$ and $B$ as the new set that contains all elements in set $A$ *or* in set $B$. In notation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
C & = A \cup B  \\
   & = \{x: x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

::: {.example name="Example of unions"}
$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= \{1, 2, 3\} \\
B &= \{3, 4, 5\} \\
C &= A \cup B  = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
D &= \{\text{First Year Cohort} \} \\
E &= \{\text{Me} \} \\
F &= D \cup E = \{ \text{First Year Cohort, Me} \}
\end{aligned}
$$

:::

::: {.definition name="Intersection"}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. Define the **Intersection** of sets $A$ and $B$ as the new set that contains all elements in set $A$ *and* set $B$. In notation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
C  & = A \cap B \\
  & = \{x: x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

::: {.example name="Example of intersections"}
$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= \{1, 2, 3\} \\
B &= \{3, 4, 5\} \\
C &= A \cap B = \{3\}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
D &= \{\text{First Year Cohort} \} \\
E &= \{\text{Me} \} \\
F &= D \cap E = \emptyset
\end{aligned}
$$

:::

### Some facts about sets

1. $A \cap B = B \cap A$
    * The intersection of $A$ and $B$ is the same as the intersection of $B$ and $A$
1. $A \cup B = B \cup A$
    * The union of $A$ and $B$ is the same as the intersection of $B$ and $A$
1. $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$
    * Two different ways of describing the set of objects that belongs to all three of $A, B, C$
1. $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$
    * Two different ways of describing the set of objects that belongs to at least one of $A, B, C$
1. $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
    * Two different ways of describing the set of members of $A$ that are also in either $B$ or $C$
1. $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
    * Two different ways of describing the set that contains either the members of $A$ or the intersection of sets $B$ and $C$

## Functions

### Ordered pairs

You've seen an **ordered pair** before,

$$(a, b)$$

::: {.definition name="Cartesian product"}
Suppose we have two sets, $A$ and $B$. Define the **Cartesian product** of $A$ and $B$, $A \times B$ as the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$, where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. In other words,

$$
A \times B = \{(a, b): a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \}
$$
:::

::: {.example name="Cartesian product"}
$A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{3, 4\}$, then,

$$A \times B = \{ (1, 3); (1, 4); (2, 3); (2, 4) \}$$
:::

### Relation

::: {.definition name="Relation"}
A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs.  A **function** $F$ is a relation such that,

$$
(x, y) \in F ; (x, z) \in F \Rightarrow y = z
$$

We will commonly write a function as $F(x)$, where $x \in \mbox{Domain} \, F$ and $F(x) \in \mbox{Codomain} \, F$. It is common to see people write,

$$
F:A \rightarrow B
$$
  
where $A$ is domain and $B$ is codomain.
:::

Examples include:

```{r example-relations}
function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) x) +
  labs(
    title = expression(F(x) == x),
    y = expression(F(x))
  )

function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) x^2) +
  labs(
    title = expression(F(x) == x^2),
    y = expression(F(x))
  )

function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = sqrt, n = 501) +
  labs(
    title = expression(F(x) == sqrt(x)),
    y = expression(F(x))
  ) +
  xlim(0, 4)
```

### Relation vs. function

A **mathematical function** is a mapping which gives a correspondence from one measure onto exactly one other for that value. This means mapping from one defined space to another, such as $F \colon \Re \rightarrow \Re$. Think of it as a machine that takes as an input some value, applies a transformation to it, and spits out a new value

::: {.example}
$$F(x) = x^2 - 1$$
    
Maps $x$ to $F(x)$ by squaring $x$ and subtracting 1.
:::

#### Not a function

All functions are relations, but not all relations are functions. Functions have exactly one value returned by $F(x)$ for each value of $x$, whereas relations may have more than one value returned.

```{r y2}
tibble(
  x = rev(seq(0, 10, by = .01)),
  y = sqrt(5 * x)
) %>%
  bind_rows(tibble(
    x = seq(0, 10, by = .01),
    y = sqrt(5 * x) * -1
  )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Not a function",
    subtitle = expression(y^{
      2
    } == 5 * x)
  )
```

```{r less-than}
tibble(
  x = seq(from = -5, to = 5),
  y = 2 * x,
  ymin = -10
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ymin, ymax = y), alpha = .75) +
  labs(
    title = "Not a function",
    subtitle = expression(y < 2 * x)
  )
```

### Two major properties of functions

$$F(x) = y$$

1. A function is **continuous** if it has no gaps in its mapping from $x$ to $y$
1. A function is **invertible** if its reverse operation exists:

    $$G^{-1}(y) = x, \text{where } G^{-1}(G(x)) = x$$

Not all functions are continuous and invertible:

$$
F(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            \frac{1}{x} & \quad x \neq 0 \text{ and } x \text{ is rational}\\
            0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$

```{r non-continuous}
tibble(
  x = seq(-5, 5, by = 0.01),
  y = 1 / x,
  group = y > 0
) %>%
  filter(x != 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, group = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Non-continuous function",
    subtitle = expression(F(x) == frac(1, x)),
    x = expression(x),
    y = expression(F(x))
  )
```

```{r non-invertible}
invertible <- tibble(
  x = seq(-5, 5, by = 0.01),
  y = x^2
)

ggplot(invertible, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(
    title = "Non-invertible function",
    subtitle = expression(F(x) == x^2),
    x = expression(x),
    y = expression(F(x))
  )

ggplot(invertible, aes(y, x)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(
    title = "Non-invertible function",
    subtitle = expression({
      F^-1
    }(y)),
    x = expression({
      F^-1
    }(y)),
    y = expression(x)
  )
```

**We want functions to be continuous and invertible.** For example, functions must be continuous and invertible to calculate [derivatives](sequences-derivatives.html#derivatives) in calculus. This is important for optimization and solving for parameter values in modeling strategies.

With non-continuous functions, we cannot do much to fix them. However non-invertible functions can be made invertible by restricting the **domain**.
    
```{r restrict-domain}
invertible %>%
  filter(x >= 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y, x)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(
    title = "Invertible function",
    subtitle = expression(paste({
      F^-1
    }(y), ",    ", y >= 0)),
    x = expression({
      F^-1
    }(y)),
    y = expression(x)
  )
```

## Quadratic functions

Consider the function

$$y = ax^2$$

where $a$ is a real number such that $a \neq 0$. The graph of the function has one of two possible shapes, depending on whether $a$ is positive or negative:

```{r u-shape}
{
  function_plot +
    stat_function(fun = function(x) x^2) +
    labs(
      title = expression(a > 0)
    )
} + {
  function_plot +
    stat_function(fun = function(x) -1 * x^2) +
    labs(
      title = expression(a < 0)
    )
} +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "Parabolas with vertex at the origin",
    subtitle = expression(y == ax^2)
  )
```

::: {.definition name="Quadratic function"}
A function of the form

$$y = ax^2 + bx + c$$
  
where $a,b,c$ are real numbers with $a \neq 0$.
:::

The graph of such a function still takes the form of a parabola, but the vertex is not necessarily at the origin.

### Quadratic equation

::: {.definition name="Quadratic equation"}
A **quadratic equation** takes the form $f(x) = 0$ where $f$ is a quadratic function.
:::

To **solve the equation**, we need to determine the value of $x$ which satisfies the equation.

::: {.example}
$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 - 7 &= 0 \\
x^2 &= 7 \\
x &= \pm \sqrt{7}
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r quad-eq1}
function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) x^2 - 7) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-sqrt(7), sqrt(7)), linetype = 4, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = expression(x^2 - 7 == 0),
    subtitle = bquote(paste("x = \U00B1", sqrt(7)))
  )
```
:::

::: {.example}
$$

## Systems of linear equations

Extending from the previous examples, often we need to find the solution to **systems of linear equations**, or multiple equations with overlapping variables such as:

$$
\begin{matrix}
			x  & - & 3y & = & -3\\
			2x & + &  y & = &  8
			\end{matrix}
$$

More generally, we might have a system of $m$ equations in $n$ unknowns

$$
\begin{matrix}
			a_{11}x_1  & + & a_{12}x_2 & + & \cdots & + & a_{1n}x_n & = & b_1\\
			a_{21}x_1  & + & a_{22}x_2 & + & \cdots & + & a_{2n}x_n & = & b_2\\
			\vdots     &   &     &   & \vdots &   &     & \vdots & \\
			a_{m1}x_1  & + & a_{m2}x_2 & + & \cdots & + & a_{mn}x_n & = & b_m
\end{matrix}
$$

A **solution** to a linear system of $m$ equations in $n$ unknowns is a set of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ that satisfy each of the $m$ equations.

::: {.example}
$x=3$ and $y=2$ is the solution to the above $2\times 2$ linear system. If you graph the two lines, you will find that they intersect at $(3,2)$.

```{r lin-sys}
function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) (1 / 3) * x + 1) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) -2 * x + 8) +
  labs(
    title = expression(atop(x - 3 * y == -3, 2 * x + y == 8)),
    x = expression(x),
    y = expression(y)
  ) +
  xlim(0, 4)
```
:::

Does a linear system have one, no, or multiple solutions? For a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns (i.e., two lines):

* __One solution:__ The lines intersect at exactly one point.
* __No solution:__  The lines are parallel.
* __Infinite solutions:__ The lines coincide.

### One solution

Here we consider solving the linear system by substitution and elimination of variables. Consider the example

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x + 2y &= 8 \\
2x + 5y &= 9
\end{aligned}
$$

To start we need to eliminate one unknown from one equation, allowing us to solve for the other unknown. Here we can do so by eliminating $x$ from the second equation by subtracting a suitable multiple of the first equation. Specifically, we can multiply the first equation by $2/3$ ($2x + \frac{4}{3}y = \frac{16}{3}$) to give us the resulting system of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x + 2y &= 8 \\
(5 - \frac{4}{3})y &= 9 - \frac{16}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

The second equation resolves to

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{11}{3}y &= \frac{11}{3} \\
y &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

We then substitute $y = 1$ back into the first equation and find that

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x + 2(1) &= 8 \\
3x &= 6 \\
x &= 2
\end{aligned}
$$

So the solution to the system is

$$x = 2, y = 1$$

### No solution

Consider instead the linear system

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x + 2y &= 8 \\
6x + 4y &= 9
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r lin-sys-none}
function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) -(3/2) * x + 4) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) -(3/2) * x + (9 / 4)) +
  labs(
    title = expression(atop(3 * x + 2 * y == 8, 6 * x + 4 * y == 9)),
    x = expression(x),
    y = expression(y)
  ) +
  xlim(0, 4)
```

If we try to solve the system of equations by subtracting twice the first equation from the second equation, we end up with a new equation of

$$0 = -7$$

Clearly nonsensical. And graphically we can see these are two parallel lines which will never intersect.

### Infinite solutions

The final type of outcome is illustrated by the system of equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x + 2y &= 8 \\
6x + 4y &= 16
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r lin-sys-inf}
function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) -(3/2) * x + 4) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) -(3/2) * x + 4) +
  labs(
    title = expression(atop(3 * x + 2 * y == 8, 6 * x + 4 * y == 16)),
    x = expression(x),
    y = expression(y)
  ) +
  xlim(0, 4)
```

If we subtract twice the first equation from the second equation, we get

$$0 = 0$$

While true, this is somewhat tautological. That is, we really only have one equation. The second equation is just 2 times the first equation.

### Three equations in three unknowns

We can extend this general method to systems with three linear equations in three unknowns.^[And in fact, even even more equations and unknowns but we'll leave that to our unit on [matricies](matrix-inversion-decomposition.html).] Consider the system of equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x &+ 7y &+ z &= 2 \\
&\quad\; 3y &- 2z &= 7 \\
&& 4z &= 4
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a **triangular** system because of its unique trianglular pattern of the equations. This relatively easy to solve via **back-substitution** since we can immediately solve for $z$ with the third equation ($z = 1$), substitute this value into the second equation to calculate

$$
\begin{aligned}
3y - 2 (1) &= 7 \\
3y - 2 &= 7 \\
3y &= 9 \\
y &= 3
\end{aligned}
$$

and substitute both these values into the first equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 7(3) + 1 &= 2 \\
2x + 22 &= 2 \\
2x &= -20 \\
x &= -10
\end{aligned}
$$

The solution is therefore

$$x = -10, y = 3, z = 1$$

If systems do not already follow this form, we can eliminate unknowns from equations until we arrive at a triangular system. Consider

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x &+ 4y &+ z &= 5 \\
x &+ y &+ z &= 6 \\
2x &+ 3y &+ 2z &= 6
\end{aligned}
$$

We can leave the first equation and eliminate $x$ from the second and third equations by subtracting suitable multiples of the first equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x &+ 4y &+ z &= 5 & \\
&- y &+ \frac{1}{2}z &= \frac{7}{2} &\quad \text{- 1/2 times the first equation}\\
&- y &+ z &= 1 &\quad \text{- the first equation}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, eliminate $y$ from the third equation by subtracting the second equation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x &+ 4y &+ z &= 5 \\
&- y &+ \frac{1}{2}z &= \frac{7}{2} \\
& &+ \frac{1}{2}z &= -\frac{5}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using backsubstitution, we arrive at the solution

$$z = -5, y = \frac{1}{2}(z - 7) = \frac{1}{2} \times (-12) = -6, x = \frac{1}{2}(5 - z) - 2y = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 + 12 = 17$$

$$x = 17, y = -6, z = -5$$

### Gaussian elimination

In addition to adding and subtracting multiples of one equation from another, we can also introduce **elementary operations** to interchange the order of equations to more easily arrive at a triangular system. This technique is known as **Gaussian elimination**. Elementary operatons include

* EO1 - writing the equations in a different order
* EO2 - subtracting a multiple of one equation from another equation

We can alternate the use of these operations as necessary to simplify a system of linear equations to triangular form, and then apply backsubstitution to solve for the unknowns.

::: {.example}
Consider the example

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad\; y &+ 2z &= 2 \\
2 x &&+ z &= -1 \\
x &+ 2 y &\quad &= -1 
\end{aligned}
$$

To make the formatting a bit easier, I fill in the missing unknowns with 0 coefficients.

$$
\begin{aligned}
0x & +y &+ 2z &= 2 \\
2 x &+ 0y &+ z &= -1 \\
x &+ 2 y &+ 0z &= -1 
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Swap equation 1 with equation 2:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2 x &+ 0y &+ z &= -1 \\
    0x & +y &+ 2z &= 2 \\
    x &+ 2 y &+ 0z &= -1 
    \end{aligned}
    $$

1. Subtract 1/2 × (equation 1) from equation 3:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2 x &+ 0y &+ z &= -1 \\
    0x & +y &+ 2z &= 2 \\
    0x &+ 2 y &- \frac{z}{2} &= -\frac{1}{2} 
    \end{aligned}
    $$

1. Multiply equation 3 by 2:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2 x &+ 0y &+ z &= -1 \\
    0x & +y &+ 2z &= 2 \\
    0x &+ 4 y &- z &= -1
    \end{aligned}
    $$

1. Swap equation 2 with equation 3:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2 x &+ 0y &+ z &= -1 \\
    0x &+ 4 y &- z &= -1 \\
    0x & +y &+ 2z &= 2 \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$

1. Subtract 1/4 × (equation 2) from equation 3:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2 x &+ 0y &+ z &= -1 \\
    0x &+ 4 y &- z &= -1 \\
    0x & + 0y &+ \frac{9}{4}z &= \frac{9}{4} \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$

At which point we could solve via backsubstitution.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{9}{4}z &= \frac{9}{4} \\
z &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
4 y -z &= -1 \\
4 y -1 &= -1 \\
4y &= 0 \\
y &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 x + z &= -1 \\
2x + 1 &= -1 \\
2x &= -2 \\
x &= -1
\end{aligned}
$$

$$x = -1, y = 0, z = 1$$

### Functions with exponents

$$f(x) = x \times x = x^2$$

$$f(x) = x \times x \times x = x^3$$

```{r functions-with-exp}
{
  function_plot +
    stat_function(fun = function(x) x^2) +
    labs(title = expression(f(x) == x^2))
} + {
  function_plot +
    stat_function(fun = function(x) x^3) +
    labs(title = expression(f(x) == x^3))
}
```

### Common rules of exponents

* $x^0 = 1$
* $x^1 = x$
* $\left ( \frac{x}{y} \right )^a = \left ( \frac{x^a}{y^a}\right ) = x^a y^{-a}$
* $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$
* $(xy)^a = x^a y^a$
* $x^a \times x^b = x^{a+b}$

### Logarithms

* Class of functions
* $\log_{b}(x) = a \Rightarrow b^a = x$
* What number $a$ solves $b^a = x$

#### Commonly used bases

##### Base 10

$$\log_{10}(100) = 2 \Rightarrow 10^2 = 100$$

$$\log_{10}(0.1) = -1 \Rightarrow 10^{-1} = 0.1$$

```{r log-base-10}
function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) log(x, base = 10), n = 501) +
  xlim(0, 5) +
  labs(
    title = expression(f(x) == log[10](x)),
    y = expression(f(x))
  )
```

##### Base 2

$$\log_{2}(8) = 3 \Rightarrow 2^3 = 8$$

$$\log_{2}(1) = 0 \Rightarrow 2^0 = 1$$

```{r log-base-2}
function_plot +
  stat_function(
    mapping = aes(color = "10"),
    fun = function(x) log(x, base = 10), n = 501
  ) +
  stat_function(
    mapping = aes(color = "2"),
    fun = function(x) log(x, base = 2), n = 501
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", labels = list(
    bquote(log[10](x)),
    bquote(log[2](x))
  )) +
  xlim(0, 5) +
  labs(
    y = expression(f(x)),
    color = NULL
  )
```

##### Base $e$

* Euler's number (aka a **natural logarithm**)

$$\log_{e}(e) = 1 \Rightarrow e^1 = e$$

```{r log-base-e}
function_plot +
  stat_function(
    mapping = aes(color = "10"),
    fun = function(x) log(x, base = 10), n = 501
  ) +
  stat_function(
    mapping = aes(color = "2"),
    fun = function(x) log(x, base = 2), n = 501
  ) +
  stat_function(
    mapping = aes(color = "e"),
    fun = function(x) log(x), n = 501
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", labels = list(
    bquote(log[10](x)),
    bquote(log[2](x)),
    bquote(log[e](x))
  )) +
  xlim(0, 5) +
  labs(
    y = expression(f(x)),
    color = NULL
  )
```

Natural logarithms are incredibly useful in math. Often $\log()$ is assumed to be a natural log. You may also see it written as $\ln()$.

#### Rules of logarithms

* $\log_b(1) = 0$
* $\log(x \times y) = \log(x) + \log(y)$

```{block2, type = "rmdnote", echo = TRUE}
This is **extremely useful**. [Maximum likelihood estimation](mle-ols.html#maximum-likelihood) requires multiplying a bunch of really small numbers. Instead, we can take the log of that operation to add a bunch of normal-sized numbers
```

* $\log(\frac{x}{y}) = \log(x) - \log(y)$
* $\log(x^y) = y \log(x)$
