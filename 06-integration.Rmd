## Indefinite integration

So far, we've been interested in finding the derivative $f=F'$ of a function $F$.  However, sometimes we're interested in exactly the reverse: finding the function $F$ for which $f$ is its derivative.  We refer to $F$ as the **antiderivative** of $f$.

For example what is the antiderivative of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{1}{x^2} \,dx &= -\frac{1}{x} + c \\
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ -\frac{1}{x} + c \right] &= \frac{1}{x^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

We know from derivatives how to manipulate $F$ to get $f$. But how do you express the procedure to manipulate $f$ to get $F$? For that, we need a new symbol, which we will call **indefinite integration**. The indefinite integral of $f(x)$ is written 

$$F(x) = \int f(x) \,dx $$

### Many possible antiderivatives

Draw the function $f(x)$ and its indefinite integral, $\int\limits f(x) \,dx$

$$f(x) = (x^2-4)$$

The indefinite integral of the function $f(x) = (x^2-4)$ can, for example, be $F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - 4x$. But it can also be $F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - 4x + 1$, because the constant 1 disappears when taking the derivative. 

```{r integralc, fig.cap = "The Many Indefinite Integrals of a Function"}
fx <- function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) x^2 - 4, size = 0.5) +
  labs(y = expression(f(x)))

Fx <- function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) (x^3) / 3 - 4 * x, size = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) (x^3) / 3 - 4 * x + 1, size = 0.5, linetype = "dotted") +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) (x^3) / 3 - 4 * x - 1, size = 0.5, linetype = "dotdash") +
  labs(y = expression(integral(f(x) * dx)))

fx + Fx + plot_layout(ncol = 1)
```

Notice from these examples that while there is only a single derivative for any function, **there are multiple antiderivatives**: one for any arbitrary constant $c$. $c$ just shifts the curve up or down on the $y$-axis. If more information is present about the antiderivative --- e.g., that it passes through a particular point --- then we can solve for a specific value of $c$.

### Common rules of integration

Some common rules of integrals follow by virtue of being the inverse of a derivative.

1. Constants are allowed to slip out: $\int a f(x)\,dx = a\int f(x)\,dx$
1. Integration of the sum is sum of integrations:  $\int [f(x)+g(x)]\,dx=\int f(x)\,dx + \int g(x)\,dx$
1. Reverse Power-rule:  $\int x^n \,dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + c$
1. Exponents are still exponents:  $\int e^x \,dx = e^x +c$
1. Recall the derivative of $\log(x)$ is one over $x$, and so:   $\int \frac{1}{x} \,dx = \log x + c$
1. Reverse chain-rule:  $\int e^{f(x)}f^\prime(x)\,dx = e^{f(x)}+c$
1. More generally:  $\int [f(x)]^n f'(x)\,dx = \frac{1}{n+1}[f(x)]^{n+1}+c$
1. Remember the derivative of a log of a function:  $\int \frac{f^\prime(x)}{f(x)}\,dx=\log f(x) + c$

## The definite integral: area under the curve

If there is an indefinite integral, there *must* be a definite integral. Indeed there is, but the notion of definite integrals comes from a different objective: finding the area under a function.

Suppose we want to determine the area $A(R)$ of a region $R$ defined by a curve $f(x)$ and some interval $a\le x \le b$.

```{r defintfig, fig.cap = "The Riemann Integral as a Sum of Evaluations"}
# generate intervals
f3 <- function(x) -15 * (x - 5) + (x - 5)^3 + 50

d <- tibble(seq_int = seq(from = 0.1, to = 1, by = .1)) %>%
  mutate(seq = map(seq_int, ~ seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = .x)),
         d = map(seq, ~ tibble(x = .x,
                               f = f3(.x)))) %>%
  unnest(d) %>%
  group_by(seq_int) %>%
  mutate(xmax = cumsum(seq_int),
         xmin = lag(xmax)) %>%
  replace_na(replace = list(xmin = 0))

ggplot(data = d, mapping = aes(xmin = xmin - .5, xmax = xmax - .5, ymin = 0, ymax = f)) +
  geom_rect(fill = "gray", alpha = 0.5, color = "black") +
  stat_function(fun = f3) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Riemann integral as a sum of evaluations",
       subtitle = expression(f(x) == -15 * (x - 5) + (x - 5)^3 + 50),
       x = expression(x),
       y = expression(f(x))) +
  transition_time(time = seq_int, range = c(1, .1)) +
  ease_aes("cubic-in-out")
```

One way to calculate the area would be to divide the interval $a\le x\le b$ into $n$ subintervals of length $\Delta x$ and then approximate the region with a series of rectangles, where the base of each rectangle is $\Delta x$ and the height is $f(x)$ at the midpoint of that interval.  $A(R)$ would then be approximated by the area of the union of the rectangles, which is given by

$$S(f,\Delta x)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\Delta x$$

and is called a **Riemann sum**.

As we decrease the size of the subintervals $\Delta x$, making the rectangles "thinner," we would expect our approximation of the area of the region to become closer to the true area.  This allows us to express the area as a limit of a series: 

$$A(R)=\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\Delta x$$

This is how we define the "Definite" Integral.

### The definite integral (Riemann)

If for a given function $f$ the Riemann sum approaches a limit as $\Delta x \to 0$, then that limit is called the **Riemann integral** of $f$ from $a$ to $b$.  We express this with the $\int$, symbol, and write

$$\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\Delta x = \int\limits_a^b f(x) \,dx$$
  
We read

$$\int\limits_a^b f(x) \,dx$$

as the definite integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$, which is the area under the "curve" $f(x)$ from point $x=a$ to $x=b$.

::: {.theorem name="Continuous functions"}
Suppose $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \Re$ is a continuous function.  Then $f$ is integrable.

:::

::: {.theorem name="Monotonic functions"}
Suppose $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \Re$ is a monotonic function.  Then $f$ is integrable.

:::

### Counterexamples

::: {.example}
Suppose $f:[0,1]\rightarrow \frac{1}{x}$

$$\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{x} \,dx$$

Then $\frac{1}{x}$ is not integrable on $[a,b]$ because the area that the integral would represent is infinite.

:::

::: {.example}
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= 1 \text{ if } x \text{ rational}  \\
&= 0 \text{ if } x \text{ irrational}
\end{aligned}
$$

Not integrable, because every interval will contain a discontinuous jump.

:::

### Fundamental theorem of calculus

The fundamental theorem of calculus shows us that this Riemann sum is, in fact, the antiderivative. Let the function $f$ be bounded on $[a,b]$ and continuous on $(a,b)$. Then, use the symbol $F(x)$ to denote the definite integral from $a$ to $x$:

$$F(x)=\int\limits_a^x f(t) \,dt, \quad a\le x\le b$$

Then $F(x)$ has a derivative at each point in $(a,b)$ and

$$F^\prime(x)=f(x), \quad a<x<b$$

That is, the definite integral function of $f$ *is* one of the antiderivatives of some $f$.

This is again a long way of saying that differentiation is the inverse of integration. But now, we've covered definite integrals.

The second theorem gives us a simple way of computing a definite integral as a function of indefinite integrals. Let the function $f$ be bounded on $[a,b]$ and continuous on $(a,b)$.  Let $F$ be any function that is continuous on $[a,b]$ such that $F'(x)=f(x)$ on $(a,b)$. Then

$$\int\limits_a^bf(x)\,dx = F(b)-F(a)$$

So the procedure to calculate a simple definite integral $\int\limits_a^b f(x)\,dx$ is then

1. Find the indefinite integral $F(x)$.
2. Evaluate $F(b)-F(a)$.

#### Uniform distribution

Suppose $f:\Re \rightarrow \Re$, with 

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &=  1 \text{ if  } x \in [0,1]  \\
f(x) &= 0 \text{ otherwise }
\end{aligned}
$$

What is the area under $f(x)$ from $[0, 1/2]$?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{1/2}  f(x)\,dx &= \int_{0}^{1/2} 1 \,dx \\
	&= x|_{0}^{1/2}  \\
	&= (1/2) - (0 )  \\
							&= 1/2 
\end{aligned}
$$

We will call $f(x) = 1$ the **uniform distribution**.

#### Area under a line

Suppose $f:\Re \rightarrow \Re$, with 

$$f(x) = x$$

Evaluate the $\int_{2}^{t}f(x)\,dx$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{2}^{t}f(x)\,dx &= \int_{2}^{t} x \,dx  \\
	&= \frac{x^{2} }{2} |_{2}^{t}   \\
		&= \frac{t^2}{2} - \frac{2^2}{2}  \\
	&= \frac{t^2}{2} - \frac{4}{2} = \frac{t^2}{2} - 2
\end{aligned}					
$$

#### Area under a curve

Solve $\int\limits_1^3 3x^2 \,dx$

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= 3x^2 \\
F(x) &= x^3 + c \\
\int\limits_1^3 3x^2 \,dx &= F(3) - F(1) \\
&= (3^3 + c) - (1^3 + c) \\
&= 27 + c - 1 - c \\
&= 26
\end{aligned}
$$

### Common rules for definite integrals

The area-interpretation of the definite integral provides some rules for simplification.

1. There is no area below a point:

    $$\int\limits_a^a f(x)\,dx=0$$
    
1. Reversing the limits changes the sign of the integral:

    $$\int\limits_a^b f(x)\,dx=-\int\limits_b^a f(x)\,dx$$
    
1. Sums can be separated into their own integrals:

    $$\int\limits_a^b [\alpha f(x)+\beta g(x)]\,dx = \alpha \int\limits_a^b f(x)\,dx + \beta \int\limits_a^b g(x)\,dx$$
    
1. Areas can be combined as long as limits are linked:

    $$\int\limits_a^b f(x) \,dx +\int\limits_b^c f(x)\,dx = \int\limits_a^c f(x)\,dx$$

      &\approx 1617
      \end{aligned}
      $$
    
      </p>
    </details>

### Integration by substitution

From the second fundamental theorem of calculus, we know that a quick way to get a definite integral is to first find the indefinite integral, and then just plug in the bounds. 

Sometimes the integrand (the thing that we are trying to take an integral of) doesn't appear integrable using common rules and antiderivatives.  A method one might try is **integration by substitution**, which is related to the Chain Rule.

Suppose we want to find the indefinite integral \[\int g(x)\,dx\] but $g(x)$ is complex and none of the formulas we have seen so far seem to apply immediately. The trick is to come up with a _new_ function $u(x)$ such that \[g(x)=f[u(x)]u'(x).\] 

Why does an introduction of yet another function end of simplifying things? Let's refer to the antiderivative of $f$ as $F$.  Then the chain rule tells us that

$$\frac{d}{dx} F[u(x)]=f[u(x)]u'(x)$$

So, $F[u(x)]$ is the antiderivative of $g$.  We can then write

$$\int g(x) \,dx= \int f[u(x)]u'(x)\,dx = \int \frac{d}{dx} F[u(x)]\,dx = F[u(x)]+c$$

To summarize, the procedure to determine the indefinite integral $\int g(x)\,dx$ by the method of substitution:

1. Identify some part of $g(x)$ that might be simplified by substituting in a single variable $u$ (which will then be a function of $x$).
1. Determine if $g(x)\,dx$ can be reformulated in terms of $u$ and $du$.
1. Solve the indefinite integral.
1. Substitute back in for $x$

::: {.example}

Consider

$$\int \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} \,dx$$

This is particularly nasty to solve given just the rules we learned above. However, if we multiply the expression by $\frac{2}{2}$ and pull the constant from the denominator outside the integral:

$$\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} \,dx$$

we see that the derivative of $x^2 + 1$ is $2x$, which is contained in the numerator. So

$$
\begin{aligned}
u &= x^2 + 1 \\
du &= 2x \,dx \\
\int \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} \,dx &= \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} \,dx \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \,du \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \log(u) + c \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \log(x^2 + 1) + c \\
\end{aligned}
$$

* Antiderivative of $\frac{1}{x}$ is $\log(x)$ - this is known
* After integrating the $u$ function, substitute back in the original $x$ based function

:::

### Integration by parts

Another useful integration technique is **integration by parts**, which is related to the **product rule** of differentiation. The product rule states that

$$\frac{d}{dx} f(x) g(x) =  f(x) g'(x) + g(x) f'(x)$$

Another way of framing this is that if the function $g$ has a continuous derivative,

$$\int_a^b g'(x) dx = g(b) - g(a)$$

Suppose that $g(x)$ can be expressed as the product of two functions $g(x) = p(x)q(x)$. Rewriting the above integral and applying the product rule to expand $g'(x)$ we get

$$\int_a^b (p'(x)q(x) + p(x)q'(x)) dx = p(b)q(b) - p(a)q(a)$$

We can rearrange this equation to read as

$$\int_a^b p'(x)q(x) dx = p(b)q(b) - p(a)q(a) - \int_a^b p(x)q'(x) dx$$

The goal is to decompose $g(x)$ into the product of two functions, one of which is easy to integrate and the other becomes simpler once differentiated. Denote the first function by $p'(x)$ where $p(x)$ is easily found, and the second function as $q(x)$.

For indefinite integrals, integration by parts is

$$\int p'(x)q(x) dx = p(x)q(x) - \int p(x)q'(x) dx$$

::: {.example}

Simplify the following integral:

$$\int x \log(x) \,dx$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(x) &= \frac{1}{2}x^2 \\
p'(x) &= x \, dx \\
q(x) &= \log(x) \\
q'(x) &= \frac{1}{x} \,dx \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int p'(x)q(x) dx &= p(x)q(x) - \int p(x)q'(x) dx \\
&= \frac{1}{2}x^2 \times \log(x) - \int \frac{1}{2}x^2 \times \frac{1}{x} \,dx \\
&= \frac{1}{2}x^2\log(x) - \int \frac{1}{2}x \,dx \\
&= \frac{1}{2}x^2\log(x) - \frac{1}{2} \int x \,dx \\
&= \frac{1}{2}x^2\log(x) - \frac{x^2}{4} + c
\end{aligned}
$$

* Pull out the constant from the integral
* $\int x \,dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2$ - simple application of the power rule

:::

## Infinite integrals

Consider the definite integral

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_1^X x^{-2} \,dx &= -\frac{1}{x} |_1^X \\
&= -\frac{1}{X} - -\frac{1}{1} \\
&= -\frac{1}{X} + 1 \\
&= 1 - X^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As $X \rightarrow \infty, \frac{1}{X} \rightarrow 0$. Hence

$$\lim_{X \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^X x^{-2} \,dx = 1$$

which can be written compactly as

$$\int_1^\infty x^{-2} \,dx = 1$$

```{r int-x-2, fig.caption = "The area is equal to 1"}
function_plot +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) 1 / x^2, n = 501) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = function(x) 1 / x^2, fill = "blue",
            xlim = c(1, 5)) +
  xlim(0, 5) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(title = expression(y == x^-2))
```

This is an example of an **infinite integral**. Infinite refers not to the value of the integral (which is in fact the finite number 1) but to the fact that integration is taking place over an infinite integral. The crucial point is that the shaded region extends infinitely far to the right, but tapers sufficiently sharply for its area to be the finite number 1.

::: {.definition}
Suppose we have a continuous function $f(x)$ defined for all $x \geq a$, and suppose the integral $\int_a^X f(x)\,dx$ approaches a finite limit $L$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$. Then we write

$$\int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx = L$$
  
In this case, we say that the indefinite integral **exists** or **converges**.

By contrast, if $\int_a^X f(x)\,dx$ does not approach a finite limit as $X \rightarrow \infty$, then we say that the infinite integral **does not exist** or **diverges**.

:::

::: {.example}
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \,dx &= \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{1}{x}  \,dx \\
										&= \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} (\log x)|_{1}^{t} \\
										&= \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} (\log t) - \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} (\log 1) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Does not converge.

:::

### Two-sided infinite integrals

If $f(x)$ is a continuous function defined for all $x \leq a$, and if the definite integral $\int_Y^a f(x) \,dx$ approaches a finite limit as $Y \rightarrow -\infty$, we denote the limit by

$$\int_{-\infty}^a f(x) \,dx$$

If the integrals $\int_{-\infty}^a f(x) \,dx$ and $\int_a^\infty f(x) \,dx$ both exist, we denote their sum by

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \,dx$$

This property is extremely important when we discuss probability distributions, since a major property of a [probability density function](general-random-variables.html#probability-density-function) is that for a given PDF $f(x)$,

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \,dx = 1$$

### Improper integrals

An **improper integral** is an integral where the integrand is not defined at one of the limits of integration. Consider the example

$$I = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \,dx$$

In this case, the lower limit causes the problem since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \rightarrow \infty$ as $x \rightarrow 0$. Nevertheless, we can define and evaluate $I$ as

$$I = \lim_{\delta \downarrow0} \int_\delta^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \,dx$$

where $\downarrow$ means "tends from above". In fact,

$$
\begin{aligned}
I &= \lim_{\delta \downarrow0} \int_\delta^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \,dx \\
&= \lim_{\delta \downarrow0} \left[ 2\sqrt{x} \right]_\delta^1 \\
&= \lim_{\delta \downarrow0} (2 - 2\sqrt{\delta}) \\
&= 2
\end{aligned}
$$

More generally, suppose the function $f(x)$ is defined and continuous for $a < x \leq b$, but is not defined for $x = a$. If the integral

$$\int_{a + \delta}^b f(x) \,dx$$

tends to a finite limit $I$ as $\delta \downarrow 0$, then we say that the integral $\int_a^b f(x) \,dx$ exists and has the value $I$. Otherwise, we say that the integral $\int_a^b f(x) \,dx$ diverges.

## Monte Carlo and integration

Suppose that we want to compute the expected value of a function $g$ of $X$ where

$$\E[g(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) f_X(x) \,dx$$

but $f(x)$ is **complicated**.

$$f(x) = \frac{\exp\left(- \frac{(x- \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) }{\sqrt{2\pi}}$$

Substituting into $\E[g(X)]$ we have the definite integral

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \times \frac{\exp\left(- \frac{(x- \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) }{\sqrt{2\pi}} \,dx$$

```{block2, type = "rmdnote", echo = TRUE}
$f(x)$ is a [**probability density function**](general-random-variables.html#probability-density-function) and $\E[g(X)]$ is its [**expected value**](general-random-variables.html#expectation-continuous). We'll learn more about this next week, but for now the important thing to focus on is that

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \times \frac{\exp\left(- \frac{(x- \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) }{\sqrt{2\pi}} \,dx$$

is going to be incredibly difficult to calculate analytically.

Suppose we can generate random draws of $X$ $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ and we computed the arithmetic mean of $g(x)$ over the sample, then we would have the Monte Carlo estimate

$$\tilde{g_n}(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n g(x_i)$$

which is the Monte Carlo **estimator**^[The tilde symbol indicates an estimator.] of $\E[g(x)]$.

As $n \rightarrow \infty$, $\tilde{g_n}(x) \leadsto \E[g(x)]$.^[See the laws of large numbers in chapter 4 of @bertsekas2008 for proof of this.] We can demonstrate this using the above example where $\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1$. Analytically $\E[g(x)] = 0$.^[See the [standard normal distribution](general-random-variables.html#expected-valuevariance-of-normal-distribution).] If we simulate this repeatedly, we can see that as we increase the number of draws our estimate $\tilde{g_n}(x)$ converges towards 0.

```{r monte-carlo}
rerun(.n = 10, tibble(x = rnorm(1000))) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "id") %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(x_bar = cummean(x),
         n_id = row_number()) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n_id, y = x_bar, color = factor(id))) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set3") +
  labs(x = "Number of draws",
       y = "Estimate",
       caption = "Each line is a separate simulation") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  transition_reveal(along = n_id)
```

## Multivariate integration

Suppose we have a function $f:X \rightarrow \Re^{1}$, with $X \subset \Re^{2}$. We will **integrate** a function over an area. Suppose that area, $A$, is in 2-dimensions

$$A = \{x, y : x \in[0,1], y \in [0,1] \}$$

```{r a-2d-rect}
function_plot +
  geom_rect(data = tribble(
  ~"x1", ~"y1", ~"x2", ~"y2",
  0, 0, 1, 1
), mapping = aes(x = NULL,
                 xmin = x1, xmax = x2,
                 ymin = y1, ymax = y2)) +
  xlim(-1, 1) +
  ylim(-1, 1)
```

$$A = \{x, y: x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \}$$

```{r a-2d-circle}
function_plot +
  ggforce::geom_circle(aes(x = NULL, x0 = 0, y0 = 0, r = 1), fill = "grey") +
  xlim(-1, 1) +
  ylim(-1, 1) +
  coord_fixed()
```

$$A = \{ x, y: x< y, x, y \in (0,2) \}$$

```{r a-2d-triangle}
function_plot +
  geom_polygon(data = tribble(
  ~"x", ~"y",
  0, 0,
  0, 2,
  2, 2
), mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  xlim(0, 2) +
  ylim(0, 2)
```

How do calculate the area under the function over these regions?

::: {.definition name="Multivariate integration"}
Suppose $f:X \rightarrow \Re$ where $X \subset \Re^{n}$.  We will say that $f$ is integrable over $A \subset X$ if we are able to calculate its area with refined partitions of $A$ and we will write the integral $I =\int_{A} f(\boldsymbol{x}) d\boldsymbol{A}$.

:::

That's horribly abstract. There is an extremely helpful theorem that makes this manageable.

::: {.theorem name="Fubini's theorem"}
Suppose $A = [a_{1}, b_{1}]  \times [a_{2}, b_{2} ] \times \ldots \times [a_{n}, b_{n}]$ and that $f:A \rightarrow \Re$ is integrable. Then 

$$\int_{A} f(\boldsymbol{x}) d\boldsymbol{A} = \int_{a_{n}}^{b_{n}} \int_{a_{n-1}}^{b_{n-1}} \ldots \int_{a_{2}}^{b_{2}} \int_{a_{1}}^{b_{1}} f(\boldsymbol{x})\,dx_{1} \,dx_{2} \ldots \,dx_{n-1} \,dx_{n}$$

* Start with the inside integral $x_{1}$ is the variable, everything else a constant
* Work inside to out, iterating
* At the last step, we should arrive at a number

#### Multivariate uniform distribution

Suppose $f:[0,1] \times [0,1] \rightarrow \Re$ and $f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 1$ for all $x_{1}, x_{2} \in [0,1]\times[0,1]$. What is 
$\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \,dx_{1} \,dx_{2}$?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \,dx_{1} \,dx_{2} &= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{1} 1 \,dx_{1} \,dx_{2} \nonumber \\
															&= \int_{0}^{1} x_{1}|_{0}^{1} \,dx_{2} \\
															&= \int_{0}^{1} (1 - 0) \,dx_{2}  \\
															&= \int_{0}^{1} 1 \,dx_{2}  \\
															&= x_{2}|_{0}^{1}  \\
															&= 1 
\end{aligned}															
$$

#### Another example

Suppose $f:[a_{1}, b_{1} ] \times [a_{2}, b_{2} ]  \rightarrow \Re$ is given by 

$$f(x_{1}, x_{2} ) = x_{1} x_{2}$$

Find $\int_{a_{2}}^{b_{2}} \int_{a_{1}}^{b_{1}} f(x_{1}, x_{2} )\,dx_{1} \,dx_{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{a_{2}}^{b_{2}} \int_{a_{1}}^{b_{1}} f(x_{1}, x_{2} )\,dx_{1} \,dx_{2} &= \int_{a_{2}}^{b_{2}} \int_{a_{1}}^{b_{1}} x_{1} x_{2} \,dx_{1} \,dx_{2} \\
 &= \int_{a_{2}}^{b_{2}} \frac{x_{1}^2}{2} x_{2} |_{a_{1}}^{b_{1}} \,dx_{2} \\
 &= \frac{b_{1}^{2} - a_{1}^{2} }{2}  \int_{a_{2}}^{b_{2}} x_{2} \,dx_{2} \\
 &= \frac{b_{1}^{2} - a_{1}^{2} }{2} \left( \frac{x_{2}^{2} }{2} |_{a_{2}}^{b_{2}} \right ) \\ 
 &= \frac{b_{1}^{2} - a_{1}^{2} }{2} \frac{b_{2}^{2} - a_{2}^{2} }{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Exponential distributions

Suppose $f:\Re^{2}_{+} \rightarrow \Re$ and that

$$f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 2 \exp(-x_{1}) \exp(-2 x_{2} )$$

Find $\int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} f(x_{1}, x_{2})$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} f(x_{1}, x_{2}) &= 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \exp(-x_{1}) \exp(-2x_{2}) \,dx_{1} \,dx_{2} \\
&= 2 \int_{0}^{\infty}\exp(-x_{1}) \,dx_{1}\int_{0}^{\infty}  \exp(-2x_{2}) \,dx_{2}  \\
&= 2 ( - \exp(-x)|^{\infty}_{0} ) (-\frac{1}{2} \exp(-2x_{2} ) |^{\infty}_{0}  )  \\
&= 2 \left[  (- \lim_{x_{1} \rightarrow \infty} \exp(-x_{1} )  + 1 ) (-\frac{1}{2} \lim_{x_{2} \rightarrow \infty} \exp(-2x_{2})  + \frac{1}{2} ) \right] \\
&=  2 [ \frac{1}{2} ]  \\
&= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

### More complicated bounds of integration

So far, we have integrated over **rectangles.** But often, we are interested in more complicated regions. 

```{r a-2d-triangle}
```

How do we do this?

#### Example: more complicated region

Suppose $f:[0,1] \times [0,1] \rightarrow \Re$, $f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1} + x_{2}$. Find area of function where $x_{1} < x_{2}$.

Trick: we need to determine bound. If $x_{1}< x_{2}$, $x_{1}$ can take on any value from $0$ to $x_{2}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\iint_{x_{1}< x_{2}}  f(\boldsymbol{x}) &= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{x_{2}} x_{1} + x_{2} \,dx_{1} \,dx_{2}  \\
&= \int_{0}^{1} x_{2} x_{1} |_{0}^{x_{2}} \,dx_{2}  + \int_{0}^{1} \frac{x_{1}^{2} }{2} |_{0}^{x_{2} }  \\
&= \int_{0}^{1} x_{2}^{2} \,dx_{2}  + \int_{0}^{1} \frac{x_{2}^2}{2}  \\
&= \frac{x_{2}^{3} }{3}|_{0}^{1} + \frac{x_{2}^{3}}{6}|_{0}^{1}  \\
&= \frac{1}{3}  + \frac{1}{6}  \\
&= \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}  
\end{aligned}
$$

Consider the same function and let's switch the bounds.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\iint_{x_{1}<x_{2}} f(\boldsymbol{x}) &= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{x_{1}}^{1} x_{1} + x_{2} \,dx_{2} \,dx_{1} \\
													&= \int_{0}^{1} x_{1}x_{2}|_{x_{1}}^{1}  +  \int_{0}^{1} \frac{x_{2}^{2}}{2} |_{x_{1}}^{1}\,dx_{1}  \\
													&= \int_{0}^{1} x_{1} - x_{1}^2 + \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{2} - \frac{x_{1}^2}{2} \,dx_{1}  \\
													&=  \frac{x_{1}^2}{2}|_{0}^{1}  - \frac{x_{1}^{3}}{3}|_{0}^{1}  + \frac{x_{1}}{2}|_{0}^{1}  - \frac{x_{1}^{3}}{6}|_{0}^{1}  \\
													&= \frac{1}{2}  - \frac{1}{3}  + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6}  \\
													&= 1 - \frac{3}{6}  \\
													&= \frac{1}{2}  
\end{aligned}													
$$
